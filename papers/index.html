The key premise of this research tradition is that democratic societies live on a “social consensus” over a set of democratic values; a democratic norm. Yet, until today scholarship has neither carefully theorized the role of nor measured the social nature of this consensus. Building on research in social psychology, we conceptualize democratic norms as social norms: citizens may think that most people in democracies support its institutions (descriptive norm) and also that one ought to do so (injunctive norm). We then measure these perceptions across 14 countries using nationally representative surveys covering 31% of the world’s population. We find that citizens have a strong perception of social democratic norms; however, mostly on abstract forms of support. Using a vignette experiment we also reveal that respondents’ preferences are conditional on their perception of social norms.

However, it remains unclear how and to what extent we can measure it. Reviewing relevant literature focusing on this problem, we argue that the most promising way to measure social desirability bias is manipulating it globally through an experimental design placed at the very start of a survey. This approach—if successful—allows researchers to achieve three crucial goals that other approaches fall short in achieving simultaneously: 1) assuring that social desirability rather than confounders is measured, 2) allowing for checking whether social desirability was actually manipulated, and 3) allowing for measuring social desirability pressures in an infinite number of outcomes throughout the survey. Employing both novel treatment designs and designs already used in established research, we demonstrate with pre-registered survey experiments in the United States (N = 5,000) and Denmark (N = 3,000) that this approach is much too risky for researchers to pursue. Specifically, we show that some treatment designs repeatedly fail to achieve manipulation (i.e., respondents do not believe their answers are being observed), whereas others achieve manipulation but do not affect outcomes which we know for a fact are marred by social desirability (i.e., respondents do not care even if they know they are being observed). We end the paper by providing advice for scholars regarding which approaches are then most feasible to pursue judging by to what extent they achieve the three crucial goals reported above.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <abbr class="badge">OSF</abbr><br> </div> <div id="haas2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Does Protest Affect Bystanders?

Only a handful of studies convincingly test causal claims about protests’ effects on politics, which is crucial when studying the actual impact of protests. There is a gap in empirical research capable of testing causal claims about protests and the detailed micro-foundations of the theoretical mechanisms developed in protest research. We attempt to address this by designing and conducting a large-scale field experiment, randomly assigning citizens to observe climate strikes by Fridays for Future (FFF) in Berlin, Germany. Theoretically, we argue that observing political protest serves as a visible cue that conveys summary information about societal attitudes and behaviors, creating the impression of shifting public opinion and social norms. We find that while bystanders adapt their actual behavior in favour of protesters’ demands, their attitudes and social norm perceptions remain largely unchanged. These findings fill an important gap in the literature by unveiling the mechanisms through which protests translate into shifts in political outcomes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <abbr class="badge">OSF</abbr><br> </div> <div id="bischof2024experiment" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Using the Party as a Shield?

Recent studies showcase that US legislators are particularly responsive to their voters, even tailoring their messages toward them. But little research investigates if these findings hold for parliamentary systems which are characterized by high party discipline forcing legislators to fall in line. We theorize that in such systems legislators use their party as a shield if their opinion contradicts their constituents’ positional wishes. We test our argument in an audit study involving both legislators and actual voters during the Brexit negotiations in 2019 in the United Kingdom. Contrary to conventional wisdom about party-dominated systems we find no evidence that MPs are less responsive to correspondence from party-incongruent constituents nor that they use their party as a shield.

On the one hand, classical scholarship suggests that populist movements mobilize disenfranchised citizens by providing an alternative to established parties – the “corrective for democracy” hypothesis. On the other hand, populist parties might as well decrease voter turnout by inflaming societal divides and excluding minority groups. We turn to the Italian Movimento Cinque Stelle, arguably one of the most relevant populist parties, which followed the unusual practice of coordinating all political activities on a public online platform. We webscraped the entire event history of the Movement’s more than 1,000 local branches with over 200,000 geocoded political activities to study how the staggered local emergence of M5S chapters affects electoral turnout. Using staggered difference-in-differences models on election results and surveys spanning thirty years, our preliminary analyses suggest that the rise of M5S decreases turnout. Our findings have important implications for the study of turnout in contemporary democracies and the negative consequences of populism in the electoral arena. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <abbr class="badge"></abbr><br> </div> <div id="bischof2023localleaders" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Social Norms, Local Opinion Leaders, and Support for Policy Proposals</div> <div class="author">with <a href="https://jschultecloos.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Julia Schulte-Cloos, </a><a href="https://romansenninger.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Roman Senninger, </a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2024</div> <div class="periodical"></div> <div class="links"><a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a></div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>By involving ordinary citizens in decision-making, citizens’ assemblies can help to strengthen legitimacy and trust in democratic institutions. While previous literature has focused primarily on the effects on citizens’ trust in democratic decision-making processes, we have little insight into the potential effects they have in influencing public opinion on salient policy issues. As the recommendations or decisions made by the participants can be widely publicized, the positions advanced by ordinary citizens can provide the public with relevant cues on social norms around a given issue. This may have significant implications for voters’ opinion formation, particularly if they share a common social identity with the citizen representative. To test this argument, we present a visual conjoint experiment designed to closely mirror the actual online participation forum of the Conference for the Future of Europe, one of the largest citizens’ assemblies ever undertaken. By virtue of the conjoint design, we experimentally manipulate the policy position of the message, the extent to which the sender is conceived as an opinion leader, the polarization associated with the policy position put forward, and the sender’s shared local social identity. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <abbr class="badge"></abbr><br> </div> <div id="bischof2023affect" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Unexpected Democrats?

But elections can also incite bloodshed: they can trigger grievances among election losers and equip election winners who oppose democracy—such as the fascist right—with resources to orchestrate even more violence. Does parliamentary representation curb or fuel right-wing street violence? We investigate this question in the context of the July 1932 Reichstag elections in Weimar Germany. We match the home towns of Nazi party candidates to locations of street violence from digitized Prussian police records. Exploiting the randomness between candidates who did and did not receive just enough votes to attain a Reichstag seat we identify the effects of Nazi representation in parliament on street brawls in the Weimar Republic. Initial results indicate that parliamentary representation led to more street violence in elected candidates’ home towns, especially when NSDAP candidates had links to the Nazi paramilitary organization, the SA.

We look at the effect of states persecuting “extreme” individuals by studying the case of the Anti-Radical Decree in West Germany. Implemented in 1972, this policy allowed individuals with connections to mostly communist groups to be banned from working in the public sector. Drawing upon a newly collected data set of individuals targeted by the bans, we run regression models to estimate the effect of such bans on the political behavior of German citizens measured in surveys and official election results. In particular, we look at the long-term effects of the bans by estimating their effects on establishing the Green party, formed a few years after the policy was first implemented. We find that counties that experienced bans are significantly more likely to take protest against the bans on the streets and subsequently vote for the Green party. Added to that individuals, who voice opposition to the bans in surveys are more likely to support the Greens. The effect is stronger in counties that were more leftist, politicized, and had more public sector workers. Our findings have implications for the sets of policies democracies can use to ensure their institutional survival.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <abbr class="badge">OSF</abbr><br> </div> <div id="lang2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Place-Based Policies and Inequality Within Regions</div> <div class="author">with <a href="http://www.valentinlang.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Valentin Lang, </a><a href="https://www.delorscentre.eu/de/team/profil/person/redeker" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nils Redeker, </a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2022</div> <div class="periodical"></div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a><a href="https://osf.io/2xmzj/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>What are the distributional effects of placed-based policies?

Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we find that the world’s largest place-based policy, the EU’s Cohesion Policy, increases incomes for affluent households but barely affects low-income households in supported regions.

While a rich body of research investigates the effects of combat participation on soldiers’ attitudes, we know little about the effects of military service in the absence of combat. However, a widely shared concern is that the military socializes its draftees into authoritarian values running orthogonal to the values of civilians’ lives in democracies. I identify the causal effect of compulsory military service on recruits’ political attitudes by studying the quasi-random assignment of the re-introduced draft in Germany in 1956 using the German Socio-Economic Panel. I find that draftees are more left-leaning and show higher trust in foreigners even 40 years after their service; but also that in most regards serving has no effects on recruits. To better understand the mechanisms behind these long-term legacy effects I rely on a three-wave panel of draftees conducted by the military in 1966. Panel analyses reveal that recruits’ experiences during service do not travel beyond the workplace. Overall, the findings imply that in many ways our experiences at our workplaces might have a much smaller effect on our attitudes and values than previous research suggests.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <br> </div> <div id="bischof2021protest" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Does Exposure to Radical Right Rallies Affect Political Behavior and Preferences – Evidence From the Far Right Pegida Movement in Germany</div> <div class="author"></div> <div class="periodical"> <em>available upon request</em>, 2021</div> <div class="periodical"></div> <div class="links"><a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a></div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>What are the effects of far right movements on citizens’ electoral behavior and preferences? Previous research implies that protests and social movements can sway the public towards their goals. However research that actually studies the effect of local protests on the local community and public is scarce. Collecting the full history of local mobilization by a German anti-migration, radical right movement – the ‘Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamicisation of the Occident (PEGIDA)’ – on the street-level I study the effects on the affected communities by using Difference-in-Differences and matching methods. I find that PEGIDA increased voting for radical right parties and made the public support stricter limits on migration. But not all citizens react equally: the effects are driven by mainstream right voters, while the left backlashes. The findings have important implications for the study of public opinion in contemporary societies and political science understanding of protesters’ relevance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr "> <br> </div> <div id="cohen2020switching" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How Perception of Support Drives Vote Switching to Challenger Parties</div> <div class="author">with <a href="https://denis-cohen.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Denis Cohen, </a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>available upon request</em>, 2020</div> <div class="periodical"></div> <div class="links"></div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Daniel Bischof.
