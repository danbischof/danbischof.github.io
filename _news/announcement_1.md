#### FAQ :question: 

<ul>
    <li> <b> What does subject to extension mean? </b> </li>
    <li> It means that if we both agree your contract can be extended for another three years. So, six years in total. </li>
    <li> <b> Do I need to hold a PhD prior to applying? </b> </li>
    <li> No. You should aim to finish your PhD approximately this year (2024). </li>
    <li> <b> How flexible is the starting date? </b> </li>
    <li> Very flexible. Please apply and we take it from there! </li>
    <li> <b> I'm unsure if I perfectly match your profile description...So maybe I should not apply? </b> </li>
    <li> No. You definitely should apply. Nobody is perfect, nobody is "the" perfect fit for a job advert. </li>
    <li> <b> What are the topics I need to work/teach on? </b> </li>
    <li> I kept the call very broad because I'm very open-minded what your research is about. Same goes for teaching. I care about your ideas and how meaningful these are to the current literature. </li>
    <li> <b> Münster is a very nice city but I'm more of a Cologne person...So... </b> </li>
    <li> Cologne is commutable from Münster. I myself live in Hamburg...But teaching is in presence and so is team-bulding and learning. I'm sure we will find a way to make it work. :) </li>
    <li> <b> Do I need to work on questions related to the DEMNORM project? </b> </li>
    <li> No. Collaborating with DEMNORM is an option, an opportunity. I won't judge your application based on whether or not you want to work with my Aarhus-based team. </li>
    <li> <b> I care about mentoring. Would you be active as a mentor? </b> </li>
    <li> Yes. I think mentoring is key to a succesful career, especially as a postdoc. I've been active in mentoring programmes since I was a postdoc in Zurich. I really like helping colleagues, engaging with their ideas and seeking to bring out the best of them. You can also get in touch with my current postdocs/phds if you want to learn more about me as a mentor. </li>
</ul>
