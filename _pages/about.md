I am Professor and Chair in Comparative Politics at the University of Münster *(Germany)* as well as a tenured Associate Professor of Political Science at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University *(Denmark)*. Prior to that, I have been an SNF Ambizione *(2019-2023)* and postdoctoral fellow *(2015-2019)* at the University of Zurich. 

I primarily work on and teach *Comparative Politics*, *Political Behavior* and *Political Economy*. As a scientist, I seek to address research questions which are relevant to both the academic as well as the public debate. This means that I work on some of the key challenges contemporary democracies are facing such as the rise of extremism, its societal consequences, remedies to mitigate extremism, and the erosion of social norms more generally. My studies are primarily empirically oriented using research designs which seek to rigorously test theoretical arguments mostly with (quasi-)experimental designs.
